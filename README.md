   ## Installation
   
   In the termial, you would run npm i to install the node packages needed to run this app.
   
   ## Usage
   
   These instructions are for testing to make sure all the routes are working. After installing the node modules necessary to run this app, you would then open the terminal in the db folder and run the schema by first logging into your postgres account (example: "psql -U " and then username). Then you would need to run the seeds by opening the main folder in the terminal and typing "node seeds/index.js". Then you would run the app by typing "node server.js" (nodemon in an acceptable alternative to typing "node"). Then you would open Postman (or another similar functioning app), make sure the route you are checking is correct (options are categories, products, and tags) and you can then check GET and POST routes, and also check GET, PUT, and DELETE for a single id by adding "/" and the id to the route destination field.
